# Flying Bear Ghost 5 Usage Experience

As of now I'm an owner of the Flying Bear Ghost 5 3D printer and here I'd like to share all my findings about this printer - based on own experience as well as any resouces found over the Internet.

First of all - my first ever 3D print :tada:

## General Information

### Hardware

My copy of this printer is based on the following hardware:

- Main board: MKS Robin Nano v1.2 with STM32F103VE6
- Stepper motor drivers: 2xTCM2208 v2.0(X + Y), 2xA4988 (Z + extruder)
- Stepper motors:
  - X: 42HY40-1.8-31.5B
  - Y: 42HY47-2-24
  - Z: 42HY47-2-12
  - E0: 42HY40-1.8-31.5B

Here is how the mainboard looked right after the purchase:
